ðŸ¤– Waters my plants ðŸŒ± ðŸ¦¾

A single-purpose, low-power plant watering node. It wakes from deep sleep every 72 hours, samples a capacitive soil moisture sensor, and if dryness is detected, it runs a small pump. Then it returns to deep sleep.

## Install

I used [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) to build and upload the code to the ESP32. Get the VSCode extension or just install the CLI tool.

```bash
pio project init --board esp32dev
```

## Build and deploy

```bash
pio run -e esp32dev -t upload
```

## Hardware

[ESP32 microcontroller](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-ESP-WROOM-32-Development-Microcontroller-Integrated/dp/B0718T232Z/ref=sr_1_3_pp?crid=2CQV94O1OGR6H&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kzd_BN2te2KAhw5tyJI73iwZ9stA77zzn51rdKmEszU4feVIJwvlwVF7kBoWgQPeMgyoptu8p8PzFvEWpxs40OoVDV9nYCBotN80_zApyaZimXkio5ei2YzGSVvl4dqeCSIJUxzCsaTnyW31OWoWwsTuaZWMGaY5S9vqwavqU0O-cqKcmrz-FhhcZC4ucgOs61cPUe_J0Nli8lbT-HIqCe1nEO4xkyimmhq6HhRRjuQ.lS9xh2RYkxiqmAJ3G8zQThrpcej4UvebpuDbfTgma1s&dib_tag=se&keywords=esp32&qid=1755052045&sprefix=esp%2Caps%2C191&sr=8-3) - A low-power microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. It is used to control the watering system.

It provides 3.3V and 5V outputs.

[Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SYBSHGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) - Corrosion Resistant Moisture Detection Garden Watering for Arduino DIY 3.3~5.5V

[Adafruit 4546 Submersible 3V DC](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085KYZCDV?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) - A small 3V DC pump that can be used to water plants. a DC motor that is powered with 3V and draws 100mA. When powered, the pump sucks water in from the side of the plastic casing and pushes it out the tubing port. The pump must be primed by keeping it inside water at all times. You can PWM the motor to speed up or slow down the flow rate.

[RFP30N06LE RFP30 N-Channel Power MOSFET](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZKYXN2M?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) - The MOSFET when it recieves 3.3v HIGH signal from the ESP32 will complete the pump circuit to ground allowing the pump to run. The MOSFET is used to switch the pump on and off.

[1N5819 Schottky Diode](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1V6Y8ND?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) - A diode that is used to protect the MOSFET from back EMF when the pump is turned off. The cathode of the diode is connected to the +3.3V supply and the anode is connected to the pump negative terminal.

## Wiring

<img src="./image.png" width="1400" alt="Sprinkletron GPIO Pinout">

I used a breadboard to wire the components together. The wiring is as follows:

- Soil moisture sensor:

  - VCC â†’ 3V3
  - GND â†’ GND
  - A0 â†’ GPIO36 (ADC1)

  Sensor values vary, best to test in your own setup.

- Pump:

  - VCC â†’ 3V3
  - GND â†’ GND
  - IN â†’ GPIO18 (MOSFET gate)

- MOSFET:

  - Source â†’ GND
  - Drain â†’ Pump GND
  - Gate â†’ (GPIO18 â†’ 220Î© â†’ GATE â†’ 100kÎ© pulldown to GND to keep it off at boot)

- Diode:

  - Cathode â†’ in front of pump +3.3V
  - Anode â†’ in front of Pump negative terminal

- ESP32:

  - GND â†’ GND
  - power supply â†’ 5V
  - pin GPIO18 â†’ Pump MOSFET gate

## Notes

- Make sure all ground is common between the ESP32, pump, all sensors.
- State machines are the most underrated concept in all of programming.
- PWM - understand the duty cycle.
- don't forget semicolons when compiling C++ code.

## Power & Sleep

- No WiFi/BT; deep sleep timer wake-up every 72 hours (`esp_sleep_enable_timer_wakeup`)
- Sensor power is off except during measurement to reduce corrosion & power
- sleep is measured in microseconds, be sure to convert and store as uint64_t before calling `esp_deep_sleep_start()`

## Measurement

- On wake: power sensor, wait 30s, take 300 ADC readings, bin 10 readings at a time taking mean as sensor reading to reduce noise. End up with 30 readings.

## Actuation

- If voltage > moisture min threshold run pump untile voltage < moisture max threshold or for `PUMP_MS` (default 6 s)
- Then sleep

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Noisy sensor / false dry:** median filter + enforce min hours between waterings
- **Flooding if stuck-low sensor:** hard cap on pump run time; min interval block
- **Boot-time glitches:** pump gate pulldown resistor; initialize gate LOW early
- **Power draw:** deep sleep between checks; sensor only powered while measuring

## What it does **not** do

- No networking, no clock sync, no manual override, no fancy scheduling
- It only wakes, checks, optionally waters, then sleeps
